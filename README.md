Hi! I'm Tom Joshi-Cale, and I'm a recent University of Exeter Physics with Astrophysics graduate looking for entry level roles or training in Software Development or Data Engineering.

I am proficient at coding in C due to the Computational Modelling in C module at university, and my project submissions for that module can be found in [here](https://github.com/TomJoshi-Cale/PHYM004-CompMod)

I also have experience in Python, using it for data analysis and manipulation as part of my MPhys project (some code from which can be found [here](https://github.com/TomJoshi-Cale/MPhys-YSO-Code)). I have also completed the [FreeCodeCamp.org Scientific Programming in Python](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/tomjoshi-cale/scientific-computing-with-python-v7), and the code I wrote for that course can be found [here](https://github.com/TomJoshi-Cale/FCC-Scientific-Python).

I'm not just good behind a computer screen, I also have great communication, presentation and interpersonal skills - making me a great team worker who is also capable of stepping up into leadership roles where necessary. You can view my CV [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj-ZG4vP0RwQljiSWhEgK3k-57mC?e=VlA9UZ).
